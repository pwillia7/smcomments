  Hey, I have looked into your project and it is exactly as mine. I am having a
  problem which is: the fans either work at 100% or dont work at all. Do you
  connect the PWM wire(blue) from the fan to somewhere? I cutted both the yellow
  and blue wire, isolated them and connected the power cables to the MotoShield
  Output, is this ok? Can you show me your wiring schematics, or maybe the
  simHub settings?  Best Regards.
