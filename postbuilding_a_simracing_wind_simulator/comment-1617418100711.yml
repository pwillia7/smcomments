comment: "Hey Luis -- See here https://imgur.com/a/coQkmZB. I think you probably just have a bad board. \r\n\r\nThe boards are really bad. A really smart guy recommends blowers and recommends getting 4 of those boards because that's how bad they are. Even mine will not sustain at 100% for more than a couple minutes and I need to replace it. It's my 2nd one."
